#When entering age in "Enter your birth date"
birth_year = input("Enter your birth year:")
age = 2024 - birth_year

#Python will read 1989 as "1989" - as a string, instead of a integer
birth_year= input("Enter your birth year:")
age = 2024 - birth_year
print(age)

#You must tell python to use birth_date as a interger
birth_year= input("Enter your birth year:")
age = 2024 -int(birth_year) 
print(age)
